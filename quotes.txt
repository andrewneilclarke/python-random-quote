If you really look closely, most overnight successes took a long time.
I failed my way to success.
I never dreamed about success, I worked for it.
Don't be distracted by criticism. Remember -- the only taste of success some people get is to take a bite out of you.
Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.
Love the life you live. Live the life you love.
The only impossible journey is the one you never begin.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.
Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
You never see an old man eating a Twix.
A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they know they shall never sit.
Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings.
Nothing is more precious than this day.
